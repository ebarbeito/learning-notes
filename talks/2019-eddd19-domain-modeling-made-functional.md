# Domain Modeling Made Functional

Scott Wlaschin - Explore DDD 2019

> Statically typed functional programming languages encourage a very different way of thinking about types. The type system is your friend, not an annoyance, and can be used in many ways that might not be familiar to OO programmers
>
> In this talk, Scott looks at some of the ways you can use types as part of a domain-driven design process, with some simple real-world examples. No jargon, no maths, and no prior FP experience necessary

## General notes

* There's an intersection between functional programming and domain-driven design, but not a lot of people practice it
* Is FP scary? It isn't, and adoptiong  it (at least some of its *goodies*) is very powerfull while doing DDD
  * FP is really good for Boring Line Of Business Applications (BLOBAs)

### The importance of DDD

![DDD in a nutshell ‚Äî Shared mental model](/Users/enrique.barbeito/Projects/_sandbox/learning-notes/talks/.assets/2019-eddd19-domain-modeling-made-functional.md/importance_of_ddd_shared_mental_model.png)

* All involved people have a shared mental model
  * Shared by *everybody*, including the code

## General notes

* JBrains intro to ~~integration~~ integrated test: a self-replicasting virus that invades your projects. It threatens to destroy your codebase, to destroy your sanity and your life. Good evening!
* Integrated test is any test where when it fails I cannot point right here to find the problem
  * So, it's any test where the success or failure (pass or fail result) depends on many different bits of **interesting behavoiur** at once
  * We know that one of the properties of good tests is exactly the opposite
  * It's a test that maybe uses some cluster of things. So, if it fails we don't know where the issue exactly is. It's not so clear
* About the Testing Pyramid, the unit test part is good. But the rest it isn't. He considers all those parts as integrated tests
  * It doesn't matter if you're testing a cluster of objects, or if you're testing the entire application through the user interface. All are integrated tests
* About the unit tests, he prefers to get rid of that word and talk about Isolated tests
  * Isolated tests meaninng tests that test an isolated part of the system
  * He isn't interested in testing, but in checking
* Difference between testing and  checking

> Scrum is defined completely in the Scrum Guide by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, the originators of Scrum.  The Scrum Guide is maintained independently of any company or vendor and therefore lives on a brand neutral site

## Highlights

### Definition

* Is a framework to manage and deliver complex products
* Scrum can employ various processes and techniques, but is not a process, technique or definitive method
* Is a "process framework". It still needs of product management roles
* You can continuously improve the product, the team, and the working environment (sidenote: don't agree)
* Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts and rules
* There are different specific "tactics" for using the Scrum framework

### Uses

* Started in the early 1990s
* It has been used to develop software, hardware, embedded software, networks of interacting function, autonomous vehicles, schools, government, marketing, managing the operation of organizations and almost everything we use in our daily lives, as individuals and societies
* Scrum proved especially effective in iterative and incremental knowledge transfer
* The essence of Scrum is a small team of people. The individual team is highly flexible and adaptive
* In this Scrum Guide, when the words "develop" and "development" are used, they refer to "complex work"

### Theory

* Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism
* Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known
* Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk
* Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation
* Scrum prescribes four formal events for Inspection and Adaptation: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective

### Values

* Values of commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect
* When they are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone
* Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values
* Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people

## Personal, sidenotes

* Don't agree with the whole mentioned "purpose". Scrum purpose doesn't fit with developing (technical aspects are outside of this framework, so cannot be part of its purpose)
* Don't agree about that with Scrum you can continuously improve the product, the team, and the working environment
  * The team is improved not by following scrum ideas, but agile and technical ones (like XP)
* The five points presented in "Uses of Scrum" section, they seem like bullshit to me
* The "complex work" that this guide refers when mention the words "develop" and "development" definitily **is not related to** technical-work in software development. Not only the guide, also the Scrum framework by itself

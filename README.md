# ebarbeito/learning-notes

Here is a personal collection of highlight quotes, notes and summaries on different articles and books I read, talks I watch, courses I attend and those topics which I love to learn of. Doing this helps me in my learning process. It takes longer and I usually forget tons of stuff, but it's still worth it.

Inspired in [this repository](https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes), here is my personal learning space. I keep it for myself, if you are thinking about adding your own summaries it may be a better idea to start your own.

If you have any suggestion for improvement please feel free to open an issue.
